  abstract  = {Realtime simulation of RoboCup small size soccer robots is a challenging task due to the high frame rate of input vision data and complex dynamic model of robots. In this paper we describe a new multi-robot 3D simulator for small size robot soccer domain named `grSim'. In order to decrease the model complexity and increase simulation speed, a simplified dynamic model for omni wheels is implemented. grSim has a distributed architecture, feature-rich user interface and supports all aspects of a small size robot soccer game, thus it can completely replace all hardware used by teams during software development. grSim can help software/AI developers design smarter SSL robot teams.},
